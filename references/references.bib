abstract = {Increasingly, individuals use communication technologies such as e‐mail, IMs, blogs, and cell phones to locate, learn about, and communicate with one another. Not much, however, is known about how individuals relate to various personal technologies, their preferences for each, or their extensional associations with them. Even less is known about the cultural differences in these preferences. The current study used the Galileo system of multidimensional scaling to systematically map the extensional associations with nine personal communication technologies across three cultures: U.S., Germany, and Singapore. Across the three cultures, the technologies closest to the self were similar, suggesting a universality of associations with certain technologies. In contrast, the technologies farther from the self were significantly different across cultures. Moreover, the magnitude of associations with each technology differed based on the extensional association or distance from the self. Also, and more importantly, the antecedents to these associations differed significantly across cultures, suggesting a stronger influence of cultural norms on personal‐technology choice.},

abstract = {Technology has significantly changed the way humans live. Information and communication technologies have advanced and given their important spillovers to other economic sectors. Sociocultural view of globalization posits that cultural values across the world are continuously changing. From the theoretical lens of technological determinism theory, technology of a society determines the development of its social structure and cultural values. Drawing on the sociocultural aspect of globalization and technological determinism theory, this study investigates the relationship between technology and national cultural values. Using secondary national-level data such as United Nations’ E-Government Survey and Global Innovation Index, we validate the proposed relationships. The results of the study indicate that technology is an important driver of cultural convergence pushing national cultures across the globe to converge toward two cultural values suggested by Hofstede: higher individualism and lower power distance. This study also finds that technology increases national confidence in financial markets through creation of increased transparency. The study has implications for policymakers at both national and global levels regarding how technology affects the evolution of human societies. Additional implications exist for the promotion of democracy.},

abstract = {<p> In this paper, we analyse the data on citizen participation obtained by a recent Ibero-American survey on social perception of science and scientific culture conducted in seven important Ibero-American cities during autumn and winter 2007. The purpose is to analyse the relationship between scientific culture and its behavioural dimensions, especially the willingness to engage in participatory activities. In this respect, we assume that the inclination towards citizen participation generated by processes of scientific education captures relevant political dimensions of scientific culture. The paper combines a quantitative methodology for exploiting demographic data with a qualitative approach to the phenomenon of participation. </p>},

    abstract = {Peer-reviewed publications focusing on climate change are growing exponentially with the consequence that the uptake and influence of individual papers varies greatly. Here, we derive metrics of narrativity from psychology and literary theory, and use these metrics to test the hypothesis that more narrative climate change writing is more likely to be influential, using citation frequency as a proxy for influence. From a sample of 732 scientific abstracts drawn from the climate change literature, we find that articles with more narrative abstracts are cited more often. This effect is closely associated with journal identity: higher-impact journals tend to feature more narrative articles, and these articles tend to be cited more often. These results suggest that writing in a more narrative style increases the uptake and influence of articles in climate literature, and perhaps in scientific literature more broadly.},
